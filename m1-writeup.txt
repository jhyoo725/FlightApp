What is one thing that you learned?

    - One thing that I learned through this assignment is the connection between SQL and Java and 
    how we can give information or store values in the database through the mix of these languages

One thing that surprised you?

    - One thing that I was surprised was how hard it was to debug.

A question you still have after doing this assignment?

    - Don't really have a question.

Recall the debugging technique you described in the HW3 writeup.  Did you use it or something similar when debugging M1?
(this is a simple yes/no question)

    - No

In 1-2 sentences, describe a bug in one of your M1 queries . Then, describe how you noticed the bug and, in 3-4 sentences, how you fixed it. 
If you answered “yes” above, please describe a different bug.

    - One bug that I found was a SQL Exception when we excute the Query. I have found the bug through printing out a message and 
    checking until which part of the code runs. I noticed that excuteQuery was having an error and noticed that my sql was wrong.
    I have ordered the two hop itineraries with f1.actual_time when I was supposed to order it through the total time which could
    be found through adding the actual_time of f1 and f2.

This project demonstrated how application logic can perform transformations on query results (eg, merging direct and indirect itineraries) or 
on user input (eg, salting and hashing passwords).  
What other logic would you like to see and/or implement in FlightApp's Java; ie, logic that cannot be done in SQL or by the user?

    - One thing I would like to see is the logging off after a certain time. I noticed that if there is any user that is logged in, 
    there can't be another user at all until the user quits. So I wanted to see an implementation of a user logging off after certain time
