What is one thing that you learned while doing M2?

One thing that I learned was how we could implement as we care about the concurrent transactions.

What is one thing that surprised you while doing M2?

One thing that I was surprised of how we can test for multiple options/outcomes

What is one question that you still have after doing M2?

I do not have a question after doing M2

Were you able to make any progress on your “one question I still have” from M1? 
If so, please describe how it happened. If you did not, describe how you might find an answer to it.

I didn't have any question from M1 so it was all good.

Now that you’ve seen how to use Java code to add additional verifications on data that’s saved into a database, how would you represent the CEO in that schema? 
Specifically, would you make the manager field NULLable or would you create a special “THIS IS NOT A REAL MANAGER” manager for the CEO?
In other words, which logic would you put in the schema and which logic would you put in Java?

I would represent the CEO as one of the Titles of the Employees. 
I would create a manager field NULLable to represent if the CEO is not the real manager
